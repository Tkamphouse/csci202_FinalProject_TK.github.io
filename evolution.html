I never really bought or added songs to it, because I didn't have money to get new ones. So I listened to the music my mom had downloaded onto it. It was a lot of 90's rap, some pop, and 80's Rock. I became very familiar with SnoopDogg, who was my mom's favorite artist.</p>

              <p class="card-text">It took a long while, but eventually I convinced my mom to get a family Spotify Premium Plan. It was amazing, I could listen to any song, whenever I wanted. I wasn't imprisoned to listen to some free Pitbull album any longer! With all this power I started to search for new music I had never heard before. The genre I fell in love with the most was 90's grunge. However, I listened to a lot of rap, 70's rock, and even some disco.</p>

As much as people say it sounds better on vinyl, it can sound just as good if done right, but I am not sure about better. Either way, its a fun (and expensive) hobby I've recently gotten into. </p>
