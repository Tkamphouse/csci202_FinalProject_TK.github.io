        <p class="lead">Starting out strong, with what is likely my favorite album ever. This record by Kendrick Lamar has me both screaming and dancing in my car, but also makes me contemplate the world we live in. I learnt a lot from this album. He talks about what it's like being institutionalized. He talks about how artists works cant stand on their own without being judged by the artist's actions. However there are also just absolute bangers to listen to like "Alright" and "King Kunta".  </p>

		<br>
        <p class="lead">This album by Tyler the Creator is a musical journey. He tells the story of a boy in love, but is competing with someone else over this person. The record starts upbeat where he is joyously telling about his passion, but slowly turns darker as he realizes he is slipping further and further away from the person he loves. the record ends with him realizing he doesn't love this person anymore, but still wants to be in each others lives.</p>

        <p class="lead">I don't have any sore of analysis for this record, but the reason I think this record by Alice in Chains is so great and that you should give it a listen, is just because every song is so so good. Songs like "Nutshell" and "Don't Follow" are serious contenders for my favorite songs ever. And all the other songs are great as well. This record is one of the albums which made me fall in love with grunge music.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5">Plastic Beach</h2>
        <p class="lead">This was one of the first records I purchased on vinyl. And before so, I wasn't crazy for the album. Though after listening to it from start to end a few times on my turntable, I fell in love with the listening experience that Gorillaz created. I would describe the ablum as simply, "a vibe". Each song is so groovy and soul warming. My favorite songs on the record are: "Empire Ants", "Melancholy Hill", and the self titled "Plastic Beach".</p>

        <h2 class="display-5">Classical Music</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
        <p class="lead">I fell in love with listening to classical once I started college. I always need a podcast or a show or some sort of music going on while I study. For some reason silence just drives me crazy. One day I decided to find a classical music playlist and give it a listen while I studied. I loved how the music could tell a story without ever using vocals, but if I wanted to I could focus on something else while it was on. I still listen to classical music all the time while I study. There are some amazing works of classical music out there that I believe everyone can enjoy. </p>

        <h2 class="display-5">Video Game OSTs</h2>
        <p class="lead">Games have some of the greatest songs ever created, and I mean that. They change the emotion of games, and add to the atmosphere the player is in. The game "Zelda: Ocarina Of Time", while bing one of the greatest games ever made, also has one of the best soundtracks. I remember songs like "Gerudo Desert" and "The Lost Woods" making me just stand still in the game, just so I could listen to them. So, I recommend if you are a gamer, put on an OST from one of your favorite games for some good ol' nostalgia.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5">Listening on Vinyl</h2>
        <p class="lead">I mentioned in my recommendation of "Plastic Beach", that I have some vinyl records. As of today I have 30+, and it's become one of my biggest hobbies. Though I don't believe that the music sounds any better on vinyl, I do think it changes how you listen. You get more out of an album, you see how each song flows into another, and you get the complete album experience. Even if you aren't listening to the records, having some of the albums you love in physical form is such a great way to show your love for it.</p>
