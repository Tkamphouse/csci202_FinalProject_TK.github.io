    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="lead">Music has progressively become more and more important to me as I've grown up. So much so I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing, if I had to choose one to go. Growing up songs were merely a background to whatever I was actually doing. Music during car rides or during a summer BBQ was at most something to get me excited or want to dance. <br><br>AS I have grown up and heard more styles and cultures of music, I get more out of listening. To the point where music is no longer the background, and can actually take me out of the moment and have me zoning out to the music. Songs can bring all sorts of emotion to a listener, they can educate, they can make you see or imagine things better than a picture could. And music has truly shaped me because of this. </p>
